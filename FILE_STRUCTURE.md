project/
├─ admin.html       # Admin HTML page
├─ admin.js         # Admin page JS logic
├─ connect.js       # Connection-related JS (e.g., web3 / backend connection)
├─ constant.js      # Shared constants used by the app
├─ index.html       # Main landing page

Notes:
- All files are currently at the project root.
- If you'd like a nested tree (group files into folders like `src/`, `contracts/`, `public/`), I can propose and apply a reorganization and move files accordingly.
